  utter_arduinos_trial:
  - text: Atlantis is in havoc. Thanks to the sloppiness of you and your fellow staff members, there’s been a jailbreak. You have been summoned to the trial where you must complete a series of technical tasks to prove your innocence. You’ll be required to design a car that would detect and avoid obstacles in order to escort the convict back to prison, where you need to build a robust security system to ensure these shenanigans don’t occur again. See if you can swim away from this.
  utter_circuital_dilemma:
  - text: This exciting event is all about showcasing the Einstein-like logical abilities you have in yourself, with a touch of circuit knowledge. You’ll have to design the best possible circuit for the given logical problem statement by using the given basic circuit elements, ensuring that all the time and other constraints are taken care of.
  utter_fizzbuzz:
  - text: “Coding is the language of the future.” This exciting event is bound to bring out your inner coding genius. You have to solve a total of 6 to 7 questions ranging in their difficulty level. But do not fret, even if you are an absolute beginner, this event ensures that everyone, no matter what their level is, will get something to solve. Do you have what it takes to survive Fizzbuzz and come out on top?
  utter_hackoverflow:
  - text: In this unparalleled event you’ll be working in a team, to create a web/app fulfilling all the given standards within 36 hours. But that’s not all! You’ll be allotted points based on creativity too, because as we all know-There IS no innovation without creativity.
  utter_pandoras_box_ctf:
  - text: We all know, CTF’s are the king of all the Cyber Security events. This CTF is going to be a Jeopardy Style CTF involving things like Web Cryptography, OSINT, Stephanography, and many others. You’ll get tasks or challenges and all of them have the same mission, to find the Hidden Flag. Let’s see if you’re the Dora the Explorer or the Marco Polo of finding hidden flags in CTF’s xD! *Limited registrations only!
  utter_unite_for_unity:
  - text: 'This is a game development event. The main objective of this event is to acquaint individuals with the tools and resources to design a game using the Unity Game Engine. Thus the event is divided into two themes: 1. Beginner - which is ideal for students just starting with game dev. 2. Intermediate - Ideal for students who have some experience with unity and have finished atleast some minor projects.'
  utter_frame_the_crane:
  - text: In this thrilling open event, the participants are required to design a crane which can sustain maximum load, along with ensuring that certain constraints are satisfied. Don't worry, you won't have to carry all the weight( or should I say load?) on your shoulders alone! You can also choose to form a team consisting of at most 4 members.
  utter_cool_your_engine:
  - text: 'Don’t you hate it when things start boiling up? You’ll be required to use that passion, along with your technical abilities, to design a heat shield for a given engine so that it attains the lowest possible temperature. You also need to make sure that the heat is uniformly distributed throughout the engine, so that you don’t end up burning anyone’s rear. '
  utter_fiducia:
  - text: Insecure web applications are among the greatest security threats to organisations today. This session hosted by our very own technical clubs here at IIT Goa, The ArchiTechs and The InfoSec is aimed at helping you gain an appreciation of the attack surface complexity of modern web applications, an insight into how vulnerabilities manifest and how to detect them through means of inference and signatures.
  utter_take_charge:
  - text: This is a workshop, where you'll be introduced to the wonders of the Linux Command Line Interface and get to learn some of the most powerful features that it provides. Don't have a Linux system? No worries! We'll take care of that too. Working with the Command Line offers you control and power as a user, so Take Charge of what you do on your system and let's embark on this journey to learn the Linux CLI.
  utter_chit_chat_with_chat_bot:
  - text: Has the lockdown put a halt to your hangouts? We understand. Join us in a live coding workshop that’ll teach you how to build a chat-bot, without any prior knowledge about the same. You can also test your ability in a contest that will follow, where you’ll be asked to design a chat-bot of your own adhering to the given problem statement, so you never have to worry about having no one to talk to.
  utter_pythonize_everything:
  - text: This event is not just an ordinary python workshop, it’s much much more. You’ll greatly enhance the python coder you have within you, along with also learning many different automated tasks you can do with python. Yeah, you heard it right, Automated! These include repetitive mundane tasks like taking backup of your system, sending emails, sending WhatsApp messages to a list of contacts, prioritising tasks, segregating stuff and much more.
